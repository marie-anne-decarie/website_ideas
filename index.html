        <h2>Idea 1: Mind Over Matter</h2>
        <p>Theme: Mental Health Awareness</p>
        <p>Twist: Create a “Zen Space” where the site feels like a playful self-care club, but with memes and jokes mixed in with the serious mental health tips.</p>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Self-Care Bingo: A bingo card where users check off daily self-care tasks like “Take a bubble bath” or “Say ‘no’ to something that stresses you out” (with a funny meme for each task).
            </li>
            <li>Mental Health Meme Therapy: Display funny, relatable memes about mental health to show that you can laugh at the tough stuff (while also offering helpful resources, of course).
            </li>
            <li>Therapist Joke Generator: A tool that generates “Therapist-Approved” jokes to lighten the mood, like, “Why did the anxious person bring a ladder to therapy? To work on their upward spiral.”
            </li>
        </ul>
