        <h2>Idea 3: "Equal Beats: The Fight for LGBTQ+ Rights in the Music Industry"</h2>
        <p>Theme: LGBTQ+ Rights / Music Industry Equality</p>
        <p>Concept: This website would focus on the journey for LGBTQ+ equality in the music industry, celebrating LGBTQ+ musicians, icons, and how the industry is evolving (or sometimes lagging behind) in terms of inclusivity. Think of it as a mix of pop culture news with advocacy.
        </p>        
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Artist Spotlights: Feature famous LGBTQ+ musicians (like Sam Smith, Lil Nas X, and Troye Sivan) and also indie, lesser-known artists who are paving the way for queer visibility.
            </li>
            <li>Album Reviews with a Twist: Write fun album reviews that examine both the music and the social messages in the lyrics. For example, “How ‘Montero (Call Me By Your Name)’ Was a Bold Statement and an Anthem for LGBTQ+ Rights."
            </li>
            <li>Interactive Playlist: Let users create and share their own LGBTQ+ anthem playlists. Fun feature: users can vote on "which queer song should be the next anthem!"
            </li>
            <li>Social Media Challenges: Have weekly social media challenges or hashtags that encourage users to share their favorite LGBTQ+ artists or music that made a difference in their lives.
            </li>

        </ul>
